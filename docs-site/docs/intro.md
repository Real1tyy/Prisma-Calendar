# Prisma Calendar

**A feature-rich, fully configurable calendar plugin for Obsidian.**

</div>

Built for power users and newcomers alike, it gives you multiple isolated calendars, fine-grained filtering and color rules, fast folder-based indexing, and simple but powerful recurring events ‚Äî all backed by plain Markdown notes.

## What makes Prisma Calendar different?

Prisma Calendar is built on a foundation of extreme flexibility and power, designed to adapt to your unique workflow, not the other way around.

-   **Total Configurability**: Almost every aspect of the calendar is customizable. Don't like our frontmatter keys? Change them. Want a different view, custom colors, or specific time slots? It's all in the settings. You control:
    -   **Frontmatter**: Define your own property names for start/end dates, titles, all-day events, and more.
    -   **Calendar View**: Tweak everything from the default view, first day of the week, and displayed hours to UI density and zoom levels.
    -   **Event Display**: Show custom frontmatter properties directly inside calendar events.

-   **Powerful Rule-Based Engine**: Use a simple but powerful expression language (`fm.*`) to control your calendar's appearance and content dynamically:
    -   **Coloring**: Assign colors to events based on frontmatter. For example, make all events with `fm.Priority === 'High'` red.
    -   **Filtering**: Create sophisticated views by filtering events based on frontmatter. For instance, hide all events where `fm.Status === 'Done'`.

-   **Power-User Features**:
    -   **Multiple Calendars**: Create isolated calendars, each with its own folder, settings, filters, and colors.
    -   **Recurring Events DSL**: A simple yet powerful system for creating recurring events (`weekly`, `monthly`, etc.) that generate real, editable Markdown notes.
    -   **Batch Operations**: Quickly duplicate, delete, or move multiple events at once.
    -   **Event Previews**: Hover over any event to see a preview of the note's content.

-   **Reactive & Modern**: All settings changes are applied instantly, with no need to reload Obsidian. The UI is fast, fluid, and built for a modern user experience.

-   **Lightweight & Performant**:
    -   Events are plain Markdown notes. You own your data.
    -   Uses virtual events for far-future recurrences to keep your vault clean and fast.

## Highlights

- Multiple isolated calendars (each with its own folder, filters, colors, hotkey)
- Folder-based event scanning (subfolders supported)
- Templater integration for creating event notes from your template
- Color rules with sensible default and rule-based overrides
- Event previews on hover; open on click
- Batch operations: delete, duplicate, move/clone to next week
- Recurring events DSL that generates real notes (node-based recurrence)
- Virtual events (read-only) beyond the generation horizon
- Reactive settings: changes reflect instantly

### What does an event look like?

Events are plain Markdown notes with frontmatter. You pick which frontmatter keys the calendar should read (e.g., `Start`, `End`, `AllDay`, `Title`).
