## 🎬 **Top 5 Killer Features**

### **1️⃣ Flexibility — Fully Configurable Everything**
Every aspect of Prisma Calendar is customizable. From frontmatter properties to calendar appearance and behavior, everything adapts to **your** workflow. You define the rules — Prisma Calendar follows.

**What you can configure:**
- **Frontmatter mapping** - Use your own property names (`Start`, `Begin`, `EventDate` — your choice)
- **Dynamic color rules** - JavaScript expressions for intelligent event coloring (`Priority === 'High' → #ef4444`)
- **Advanced filtering** - Show/hide events based on any frontmatter property or complex expressions
- **View customization** - Adjust time ranges, zoom levels, display density, themes, and layouts
- **Multiple calendars** - Up to 10 isolated calendars, each with completely independent settings

### **2️⃣ Reactivity — No Restarts. Ever.**
Change a setting → The calendar **immediately updates**. No more restarting Obsidian. Every parameter, toggle, or setting change is applied live, instantly reflecting in your workspace.

**Real-time updates for:**
- All settings changes apply instantly
- Color rules and filters recalculate automatically
- View changes reflect immediately
- Zero downtime — never interrupt your workflow

### **3️⃣ History & Memento System — Undo / Redo Like a Pro**
Prisma Calendar keeps a complete memento history of your actions. Every move, edit, or deletion can be undone or redone instantly. Misclicked? Don't worry — we've got you covered.

**Safety net features:**
- **Command pattern architecture** - Every action is undoable
- **Semantic undo** - See exactly what you're undoing ("Undo Create Event", "Undo Batch Delete", "Undo Move Event")
- **Full operation history** - Undo/redo across all calendar operations
- **Confidence to experiment** - Try anything knowing you can always revert

### **4️⃣ Recurring Events — Smart, Linked, Isolated**
Recurring events are built around a **source node** that defines frequency (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.). Each instance is an independent Obsidian note, fully linked to its source — giving you both structure and freedom.

**Advanced recurrence system:**
- **Source node architecture** - One configuration file controls the entire series
- **Real note generation** - Physical Obsidian notes, not just calendar entries
- **Complete inheritance** - All frontmatter properties and content copied to each instance
- **Virtual previews** - See far-future instances without cluttering your vault
- **Source navigation** - Jump between instances and their source with one click
- **Calendar creation** - Create recurring events directly from the calendar with full frontmatter support
- **Instance management** - View all recurring instances in a dropdown, filter past events

### **5️⃣ Batch Operations — Work Fast, Think Big**
Select multiple events and perform bulk actions: **clone, move, skip, delete, or open them** — all at once. Perfect for power users who value efficiency and speed.

**Bulk operation capabilities:**
- **Multi-select mode** - Click to select multiple events across your calendar
- **Batch delete** - Remove multiple events with one confirmation
- **Batch duplicate** - Create copies of selected events instantly
- **Week shifting** - Move or clone entire sets of events forward/backward
- **Skip functionality** - Mark events as skipped without breaking recurring series
- **Batch open** - Open all selected event files in editor tabs simultaneously

- **Dedicated folders** - Each calendar scans its own directory tree
- **Custom hotkeys** - Instant switching between calendars
- **Clone & duplicate** - Copy calendars with all settings intact

### 🎨 **Dynamic Visual Customization**
- **JavaScript-powered color rules** - `fm.Priority === 'High' → #ef4444`
- **Property-based filtering** - Show/hide events with complex expressions
- **Frontmatter display** - Show extra frontmatter properties inside event chips
- **Multiple view modes** - Month, week, day, list with customizable time ranges
- **Zoom controls** - CTRL+scroll with configurable zoom levels (1-60 minutes)

### 🔄 **CalDAV & ICS Integration**
- **Read-only CalDAV sync** - Automatically import events from external CalDAV servers (Fastmail, Nextcloud, iCloud, etc.)
- **ICS import & export** - Import `.ics` calendar files into Prisma, or export your calendar/events to standard ICS format for use in other apps and services
- **Auto-sync** - Configurable sync intervals with manual trigger option
- **Smart updates** - Incremental CalDAV sync using ETags for efficiency
- **Multiple accounts** - Connect multiple CalDAV or ICS sources to different Prisma calendars
- **Note creation** - Synced or imported events become Obsidian notes with full frontmatter

> **⚠️ Security Warning**: CalDAV credentials are stored in **plaintext** in your vault's `data.json` file. Always use **app-specific passwords**, never your main account password. See [documentation](/features/integrations#security-considerations) for detailed security considerations.

### What does an event look like?

Events are plain Markdown notes with frontmatter. You pick which frontmatter keys the calendar should read (e.g., `Start`, `End`, `AllDay`).
