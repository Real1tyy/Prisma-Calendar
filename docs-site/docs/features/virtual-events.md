# Virtual Events

Beyond the generation horizon, events are shown without creating files.

## Why

- Keep your vault lean while still seeing far-future plans

## Behavior

- Generated notes: up to “Future instances count” (1–52)
- Virtual items: beyond that, read-only (cannot be edited or batched)
- Convert to real: increase the horizon to generate more notes
