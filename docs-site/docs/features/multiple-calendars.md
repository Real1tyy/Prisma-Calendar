# Multiple Calendars

Separate contexts with dedicated configurations.

## Why multiple calendars?

- Keep Work and Personal events separate
- Use different color/filter rules for different projects
- Bind hotkeys to jump between calendars

## Typical setup

1. Create a Work calendar → Directory `Work/Calendar/`
2. Create a Personal calendar → Directory `Personal/Calendar/`
3. Add different color rules (e.g., Work blue, Personal purple)
4. Assign hotkeys to switch quickly

Limit: UI prevents exceeding the maximum allowed calendars.
