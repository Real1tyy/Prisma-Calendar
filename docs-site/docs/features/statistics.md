## Overview

The Statistics feature provides comprehensive time tracking visualizations that show how your time is distributed across different event categories. Choose from four different views:

- **📊 Daily Statistics**: Analyze a single day's time allocation
- **📅 Weekly Statistics**: Analyze a specific week (Monday-Sunday)
- **📆 Monthly Statistics**: Review an entire month's time allocation
- **🌍 All-Time Statistics**: See lifetime totals across all your events

Each view generates a pie chart and detailed statistics table, making it easy to understand your time allocation patterns at different scales.

## Key Features

Color-coded pie chart, paginated breakdown table (20 entries/page), period navigation, smart grouping, timed events only

## Statistics Types

### Daily Statistics

Command: `Show daily statistics`. Navigate: ← Previous day, Next → day, Today

### Weekly Statistics

Command: `Show weekly statistics`. Navigate: ← Previous week (7 days), Next → week (7 days), Today

### Monthly Statistics

### All-Time Statistics

Command: `Show all-time statistics`. No navigation, pagination for large datasets

## How Event Grouping Works

### Aggregation Modes

**Event Name Mode** (default): Groups by cleaned titles
**Category Mode**: Groups by frontmatter category. Toggle via mode button.

### Recurring Events (Name Mode)

All [recurring](./recurring-dsl) events grouped together under "Recurring Events" category.

### Non-Recurring Events (Name Mode)

Grouped by name after stripping [Zettel IDs](./zettelid-naming) (14-digit timestamps), ISO dates, and trailing timestamps. Example: `Gym 20250203140530` → `Gym`

### Multi-Category Support (Category Mode)

Events with multiple comma-separated categories (`Category: Work, Learning`) count toward each category separately. Full duration added to each. Total duration shows sum of all category entries (multi-category events counted multiple times). Events without categories grouped under "No Category".

## Break Time Property

Add `Break` property (in minutes) to exclude break time from statistics. Supports decimals. Automatically subtracted when calculating statistics. Original event duration unchanged in calendar view.

**Example**: 8-hour event with `Break: 60` shows as 7 hours in statistics.

**Automatic Tracking**: Use [Time Tracker](./time-tracker) to automatically calculate break time with ⏸ break / ▶ resume buttons.

## What Gets Included

**✅ Included**: Timed events with start and end times, events within period range, duration minus break time

**❌ Excluded**: All-day events, events without end time, events outside period range

## Understanding the Statistics

**Pie Chart**: Color-coded slices with proportional sizing and interactive tooltips

**Statistics Table**: Shows Event Name, Count, Duration, Percentage. Sorted by duration (longest first). Paginated at 20 entries per page.

**Period Summary**: Period range, total duration, total events, navigation controls (weekly/monthly only)

## Use Cases

**Daily Time Tracking**: Quick daily reviews, productivity audits, day-to-day planning

**Weekly Time Tracking**: Monitor activity distribution for weekly reviews, sprint retrospectives

**Monthly Analysis**: Review patterns for monthly reports, billing summaries

**Lifetime Patterns**: Analyze long-term allocation for annual reviews, career reflection

**Work-Life Balance**: Track work vs personal vs recurring activities across any time period

**Period Comparison**: Compare different days, weeks, or months to spot trends

## Best Practices

**Consistent Naming**: Use same base names for similar events to leverage automatic grouping

**Always Set End Times**: Events without end times excluded (duration = 0)

**Category Strategy**: Choose grouping approach (by activity type, project, or client)

**Regular Review**: Make weekly statistics review part of your routine
