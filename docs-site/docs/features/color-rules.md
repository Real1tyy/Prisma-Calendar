# Color Rules

Make events visually meaningful by mapping frontmatter to colors.

## How it works

- Set a Default event color as a fallback
- Add Color rules that evaluate in order; the first match sets the color
- Reference frontmatter properties directly by name

Examples:

```text
Priority === 'High'         → #ef4444
Status === 'Done'           → #22c55e
Project === 'Work'          → hsl(210,70%,50%)
Type === 'Meeting'          → #f59e0b
```

## Real use cases

- Status pipeline: `Todo` (gray), `In Progress` (blue), `Blocked` (orange), `Done` (green)
- Contexts: `Work` vs `Personal` vs `Health` colors
- Risk highlighting: `High` priority in red

## Advanced Examples

```javascript
// Multiple conditions
Priority === 'High' && Status !== 'Done'         → #ef4444

// Array checks
Tags && Tags.includes('urgent')                   → #ef4444

// Numeric comparisons
Difficulty >= 8                                   → #f59e0b

// Nested conditions
Status === 'Active' && (Priority === 'High' || DueDate < new Date())  → #3b82f6
```

## Category Color Management

For a convenient way to manage category colors without writing expressions manually, use the **Categories Settings** section (Settings → Categories). This interface automatically detects all categories from your events, displays event counts, and provides color pickers for each category. Behind the scenes, category colors are stored as color rules using expressions like `Category.includes('Work')`.

📖 See [Categories](/features/categories) for complete documentation on working with categories, including assignment, viewing, and statistics.

## Troubleshooting

- Rule order matters: put specific rules above general ones
- Expressions must be valid JavaScript; use property names directly
- Colors can be CSS names, hex (`#abc123`), or HSL (`hsl(...)`)
