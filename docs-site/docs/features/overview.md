## ðŸŽ¯ **Core Capabilities**

### **Multiple Isolated Calendars**
- **Up to 10 separate calendars** with completely independent configuration
- **Dedicated folders** - Each calendar scans its own directory tree (subfolders included)
- **Custom hotkeys** - Instant switching between calendars
- **Clone & duplicate** - Copy entire calendars with all settings intact
- **Independent rules** - Each calendar has its own color rules, filters, and display settings

### **Folder-Based Event Scanning**
- **Automatic indexing** - Point a calendar at any folder and notes with frontmatter become events
- **Subfolder support** - Recursively scans all subfolders in the configured path
- **Real-time updates** - File changes are detected and processed instantly
- **Smart parsing** - Efficiently handles large vaults with hundreds or thousands of events

### **Templater Integration**
- **Template scaffolding** - Use Templater templates to create consistent event metadata
- **Custom frontmatter** - Define your own property structure that works with your workflow
- **Automatic application** - New events created via calendar use your configured template

## ðŸŽ¨ **Customization & Visual Control**

### **Dynamic Color Rules**
- **JavaScript expressions** - `Priority === 'High' â†’ #ef4444`
- **First match wins** - Rules evaluated in order, first matching rule applies
- **Default fallback** - Set a default color for events that don't match any rule
- **Live updates** - Color changes reflect immediately as you edit rules

### **Advanced Filtering**
- **Expression-based** - Use property names directly to show/hide events
- **Complex logic** - Combine conditions with `&&`, `||`, and comparison operators
- **Dynamic visibility** - Filter events by any frontmatter property
- **Example**: `Status !== 'Done'` to hide completed tasks

### **Frontmatter Display**
