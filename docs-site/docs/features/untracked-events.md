# Untracked Events

The **Untracked Events Dropdown** provides a convenient way to view and manage events that don't have date properties assigned yet. Think of it as your "inbox" for calendar events.

## Overview

Events are considered **untracked** when they have **none** of the following properties:
- Start Date
- End Date
- Date

These events won't appear on the calendar but are stored in the dropdown for easy access and scheduling.

### Filtering Untracked Events

You can globally filter which untracked events appear in the dropdown using JavaScript expressions:

**Settings → Rules & Filters → Untracked Event Filtering**

**How it works:**
- Filters are applied when files are indexed
- Events must pass all filter expressions to appear in the dropdown
- Works identically to calendar event filtering but only affects untracked events
- Changes apply immediately without triggering full re-indexing

See the [Filtering documentation](./filtering.md) for more details on expression syntax and examples.

## Features

### 📋 View Untracked Events

The dropdown appears in the calendar toolbar as an **"Untracked"** button. Click it to see all your untracked events.

**What you'll see:**
- Event title (with Zettel ID removed for cleaner display)
- Configured display properties (frontmatter fields you want to show)
- Color coding based on your color rules
- Search bar to filter events by title

### 🎯 Drag & Drop - From Dropdown to Calendar

Drag any untracked event from the dropdown onto the calendar to assign it a date:

**For timed events:**
 over. Drag event from dropdown
2. Drop on a time slot in week/day view
3. Start time is set to drop time
4. End time is calculated based on default duration (configurable in settings)

**For all-day events:**
1. Drag event from dropdown
2. Drop on a day in month view
3. Date property is set
4. All Day property is set to true

### ↩️ Drag & Drop - From Calendar to Dropdown

Remove dates from calendar events to make them untracked again:

**Two ways to drop:**

1. **Drop on "Untracked" button** (dropdown closed)
   - Drag any calendar event
   - Drop on the "Untracked" button in toolbar
   - Date properties are cleared instantly

2. **Drop in open dropdown** (dropdown open)
   - Open the dropdown first
   - Drag any calendar event
   - Drop anywhere inside the dropdown area
   - Event becomes untracked and appears in the list

**What gets cleared:**
- Start Date → `null`
- End Date → `null`
- Date → `null`
- All Day → `null`

### 🔄 Smart Behavior

**Auto-hide while dragging:**
- If you hover over the dropdown while dragging an event for over **1 second**, it temporarily hides
- This prevents the dropdown from blocking your calendar view
- Reappears automatically when you finish dragging

**Stays open after operations:**
- Dropdown remains open after dropping events
- Allows you to quickly process multiple events without reopening

**Reactive updates:**
- Dropdown automatically refreshes when files change
- Instant updates when events become tracked/untracked
- No manual refresh needed

### ↩️ Undo/Redo Support

All drag & drop operations support full undo/redo:

```
Cmd/Ctrl + Z  →  Undo (revert date changes)
Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z  →  Redo
```

The calendar automatically updates when you undo/redo to show the correct state.

### 🎨 Display Properties

Configure which frontmatter properties to show in the dropdown:

**Settings → [Your Calendar] → Display Properties → Untracked Events**

Example configuration:
```
Status, Priority, Project, Tags
```

Properties are rendered with proper formatting:
- Links are clickable
- Lists are comma-separated
- Complex values are stringified

### 🎨 Color Rules

Color rules automatically apply to untracked events. If you have rules like:

```javascript
Status == "urgent" → Red
Project.includes("work") → Blue
```

Untracked events matching these conditions will show with the appropriate colors in the dropdown.

### 🔍 Search

Filter untracked events by typing in the search bar at the top of the dropdown:

- Searches event titles (case-insensitive)
- Zettel IDs are ignored during search
- Updates instantly as you type
