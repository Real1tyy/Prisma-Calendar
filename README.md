## **Top 5 Killer Features**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Flexibility ‚Äî Fully Configurable Everything**
Every aspect of Prisma Calendar is customizable. From frontmatter properties to calendar appearance and behavior, everything adapts to **your** workflow. You define the rules ‚Äî Prisma Calendar follows.

- **Custom frontmatter mapping** - Use your own property names (`Start`, `Begin`, `Date` ‚Äî your choice)
- **Dynamic color rules** - JavaScript expressions for intelligent event coloring
- **Filtering system** - Show/hide events based on any frontmatter property
- **View customization** - Adjust time ranges, zoom levels, display density, and visual themes
- **Multiple calendars** - Up to 10 isolated calendars, each with independent settings

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Reactivity ‚Äî No Restarts. Ever.**
Change a setting ‚Üí The calendar **immediately updates**. No more restarting Obsidian. Every parameter, toggle, or setting change is applied live, instantly reflecting in your workspace.

- **Instant feedback** - All settings changes apply in real-time
- **Live recalculation** - Color rules, filters, and views update automatically
- **Zero downtime** - Never interrupt your workflow with restarts

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ History & Memento System ‚Äî Undo / Redo Like a Pro**

- **Safety net** - Experiment confidently knowing you can always revert

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Recurring Events ‚Äî Smart, Linked, Isolated**
Recurring events are built around a **source node** that defines frequency (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, etc.). Each instance is an independent Obsidian note, fully linked to its source ‚Äî giving you both structure and freedom.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Batch Operations ‚Äî Work Fast, Think Big**
Select multiple events and perform bulk actions: **clone, move, skip, delete, or open them** ‚Äî all at once. Perfect for power users who value efficiency and speed.

- **Multi-select mode** - Click to select multiple events
- **Bulk operations** - Delete, duplicate, move, or clone selected events
- **Skip functionality** - Mark events as skipped without deletion
- **Batch open** - Open all selected event files in editor tabs
- **Week shifting** - Move or clone entire sets of events forward/backward
