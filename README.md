## **Top 5 Killer Features**

### **1️⃣ Flexibility — Fully Configurable Everything**
Every aspect of Prisma Calendar is customizable. From frontmatter properties to calendar appearance and behavior, everything adapts to **your** workflow. You define the rules — Prisma Calendar follows.

- **Custom frontmatter mapping** - Use your own property names (`Start`, `Begin`, `Date` — your choice)
- **Dynamic color rules** - JavaScript expressions for intelligent event coloring
- **Filtering system** - Show/hide events based on any frontmatter property
- **View customization** - Adjust time ranges, zoom levels, display density, and visual themes
- **Multiple calendars** - Up to 10 isolated calendars, each with independent settings

### **2️⃣ Reactivity — No Restarts. Ever.**
Change a setting → The calendar **immediately updates**. No more restarting Obsidian. Every parameter, toggle, or setting change is applied live, instantly reflecting in your workspace.

- **Instant feedback** - All settings changes apply in real-time
- **Live recalculation** - Color rules, filters, and views update automatically
- **Zero downtime** - Never interrupt your workflow with restarts

### **3️⃣ History & Memento System — Undo / Redo Like a Pro**
Prisma Calendar keeps a complete memento history of your actions. Every move, edit, or deletion can be undone or redone instantly. Misclicked? Don't worry — we've got you covered.

- **Command pattern architecture** - Every action is undoable
- **Semantic undo** - See exactly what you're undoing ("Undo Create Event", "Undo Batch Delete")
- **Full history** - Undo/redo across all calendar operations
- **Safety net** - Experiment confidently knowing you can always revert

### **4️⃣ Recurring Events — Smart, Linked, Isolated**
Recurring events are built around a **source node** that defines frequency (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, etc.). Each instance is an independent Obsidian note, fully linked to its source — giving you both structure and freedom.

- **Source node architecture** - One configuration file controls the entire series
- **Real note generation** - Physical Obsidian notes, not just calendar entries
- **Complete inheritance** - All frontmatter and content copied to instances
- **Virtual previews** - See far-future instances without cluttering your vault
- **Source navigation** - Jump between instances and their source with one click
- **Calendar creation** - Create recurring events directly from the calendar interface with full frontmatter support

### **5️⃣ Batch Operations — Work Fast, Think Big**
Select multiple events and perform bulk actions: **clone, move, skip, delete, or open them** — all at once. Perfect for power users who value efficiency and speed.

- **Multi-select mode** - Click to select multiple events
- **Bulk operations** - Delete, duplicate, move, or clone selected events
- **Skip functionality** - Mark events as skipped without deletion
- **Batch open** - Open all selected event files in editor tabs
- **Week shifting** - Move or clone entire sets of events forward/backward

## ✨ **Additional Powerful Features**

### 🔗 **Recurring Event Management**
- **Source button** - Navigate to source node from any recurring instance
- **Instance dropdown** - View all physical instances of a recurring series
- **Past filter** - Toggle past event visibility to reduce clutter
- **Virtual event source preview** - Click virtual events to see their source configuration

### 🗓️ **Multiple Isolated Calendars**
- **Up to 10 separate calendars** with independent configuration
- **Dedicated folders** - Each calendar scans its own directory tree
- **Custom hotkeys** - Instant switching between calendars
- **Clone & duplicate** - Copy calendars with all settings intact

### 🎨 **Dynamic Visual Customization**
- **JavaScript-powered color rules** - `fm.Priority === 'High' → #ef4444`
- **Property-based filtering** - Show/hide events with complex expressions
- **Frontmatter display** - Show extra frontmatter properties inside event chips
- **Multiple view modes** - Month, week, day, list with customizable time ranges
- **Zoom controls** - CTRL+scroll with configurable zoom levels (1-60 minutes)

### 🔄 **CalDAV & ICS Integration**
- **Read-only CalDAV sync** - Automatically import events from external CalDAV servers (Fastmail, Nextcloud, iCloud, etc.)
- **ICS import & export** - Import `.ics` calendar files into Prisma, or export your calendar/events to standard ICS format for use in other apps and services
- **Auto-sync** - Configurable sync intervals with manual trigger option
- **Smart updates** - Incremental CalDAV sync using ETags for efficiency
- **Multiple accounts** - Connect multiple CalDAV or ICS sources to different Prisma calendars
- **Note creation** - Synced or imported events become Obsidian notes with full frontmatter

> **⚠️ Security Warning**: CalDAV credentials are stored in **plaintext** in your vault's `data.json` file. Always use **app-specific passwords**, never your main account password. See [documentation](https://real1tyy.github.io/Prisma-Calendar/features/integrations#security-considerations) for detailed security considerations.
